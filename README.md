# Vulnerability-Management via Nessus Test Project
A small basic vulnerability management project 

In this project, my goal was to use Nessus essentials to scan for vulnerabilities on a VM created via VMware workstation player. I began by first downloading and installing both Nessus essentials and VMware workstation and installing windows 10 on the VM. I linked the Nessus with the new VM using the IP address and configuring the VM. I disabled Microsoft firewall features on the VM & ran my first test scan.  

1st 'test' scan:

  After the first test, I went to the Remote registry in the VM and turned on the feature in purpose for the 2nd Nessus scan to crawl through the registry and scan all relative files. I also enabled and configured credentials into the scan and added an older version of FireFox web browser for the purpose of showing more vulnerabilities and observing how Nessus would react. 
  
 2nd 'test' scan:

  Additionally, more vulnerabilities were discovered. To remediate some of the critical alerts, I uninstalled Firefox and updated the windows VM, and enabled Microsoft defender. In doing so this immediately lowered the alerts and produced the intended results. 

Final 'test' scan:
