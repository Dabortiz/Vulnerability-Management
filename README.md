# Vulnerability-Management via Nessus Test Project
A small basic vulnerability management project 

In this project my goal was to use Nessus essentials to scan for vulnerabiltiies on a VM created via VMware workstation player. I began by first downloading and installing both Nessus essentials and VMmare workstation and installing windows 10 on the VM. I linked the Nessus with the new VM using the IP address and configuring the VM. I disabled Microsoft firewall features on the VM & ran my first test scan.  

1st 'test' scan:

  After the first test, I went to the Remote registy in the VM and turned on the feature in purpose for the 2nd Nessus scan to crawl through the registy and scan all relative files. I also enabled and configured credentials into the scan and added an older version of FireFox web broswer for the purpose of seeing more vulnerabilties and seeing how Nessus would react. 
  
 2nd 'test' scan:

  Thereupon, many more vulnerabilties were discovered. To remediate some of the cricital alerts, I unistalled Firefox and updated the windows VM, and enabled Microsoft defender. In doing so this immeditaly lowered the alerts and produced the intended results. 

Final 'test' scan:
