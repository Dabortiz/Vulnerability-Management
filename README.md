# Vulnerability-Management
A small basic vulnerability management project 

In this project my goal was to use Nessus essentials to scan for vulnerabiltiies on a VM created via VMware workstation player. I began by first downloading and installing both Nessus essentials and VMmare workstation and installing windows 10 on the VM. I linked the Nessus with the new VM using the IP address, then I disabled off Microsoft firewall features on the VM. After this process, I went to the Remote registy for the VM and turned on the feature in purpose for the SCAN made in Nessus could crawl through the registy and scan all files. Finally, for the final 'test' scan, I enabled and configured credentials into the scan for the purpose of seeing more vulnerabilties. To add more vulnerabilties into the scan, I downloaded an old verison of Firefox for the goal to see how the scanner would read the outdated web broswer. In doing so, many more vulnerabilties were discovered. After wards to remediate some of the cricital alerts, I unistalled Firefox and updated the windows VM, doing so lowered the scans and produced the intended results.
